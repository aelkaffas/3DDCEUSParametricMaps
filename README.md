# 3DDCEUSParametricMaps
Code to generate parametric maps from 4D contrast ultrasound data based on certain parameters. Code uses parallel processing. 

To run the code, you'll need python 2.6, and see example within the RunBolus* codes. There are several options, including proper linearization for EPIQ7 and iU22 systems, and scaling factors. Before running, you should read through comments in the main files.
